Time complexity of the quick sort for the implementation where pivot will be the median element is O(nlog n) :

--> to find the pivot element that is the median O(n)
--> to split the array into sub arrays O(n)
--> rest simple steps O(C), can be ignored for higher values of n
--> recursive calls O(log n + 1) i.e O(log n)

total time complexity --> (O(n) + O(n)) * O(logn) = O(2n) * O(logn) = O(2n logn) = 2 O(n logn) = O(n logn)
