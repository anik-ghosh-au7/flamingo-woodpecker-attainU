Adjacency list is a way to represent a graph which is nothing but a dictionary in python where each node or vertex is the key
and if the graph is unweighted then the value of each key is just the list of vertices that the key vertex is connected to and
for a weighted graph the values are a list of tuples where each tuple is a combination of the adjacent vertex and the weight
associated with it.

Adjacency matrix is also just another way to represent a graph, here we consider a two dimensional array or a nested list in
case of python, the size of the array is dependent on the number of nodes present in the graph, so for example if a graph has
three vertices then the array will be of 3 x 3 size i.e there will be a three columns and three rows present, and the value of
each coordinate of the array will be 1 if there exists an edge in between those coordinates else it will be 0 for an unweighted
graph and for weighted graph the value will be the weight associated to that edge.
