Coding Challenge

Given two strings, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
Find the length of LCS in O(n) auxiliary space.


Assignment

Given an array, find the longest increasing subsequence in it.

Input: arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output: Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input: arr[] = {3, 2}
Output: Length of LIS = 1
The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

Input: arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
Output: Length of LIS = 4
The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
