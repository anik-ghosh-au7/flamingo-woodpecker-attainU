CC:

1) Suppose we have a O(n) time algorithm that finds median of an unsorted array. Now consider a QuickSort implementation where we first find median using the above algorithm, then use median as pivot. What will be the worst case time complexity of this modified QuickSort.

Assignment:

1) Write the python code for which sorting algorithm to select given a list. You can leave the methods itself blank by using the pass keyword.

EX:
```python3
def sortingAlgorithm(arr):
  pass
```
