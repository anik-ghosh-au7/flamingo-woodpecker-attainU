CC:

1) Given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B.
Merge B into A in sorted order.

Examples:

Input : a = [10, 12, 13, 14, 18, None, None, None, None, None]
        b = [16, 17, 19, 20, 22]
Output : a = [10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22]

Assignment:

1) Implement Merge Sort in-place
[In-place means it does not occupy extra memory for merge operation as in standard case.]
