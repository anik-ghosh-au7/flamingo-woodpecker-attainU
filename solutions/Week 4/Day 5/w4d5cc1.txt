Time complexity of the quick sort for the implementation where pivot will be the median element is O(nlog n) :

--> to find the pivot element that is the median O(n)
--> to split the array into sub arrays O(n)
--> rest simple steps O(C)
--> recursive calls O(log n + c), c is constant so O(log n)

total time complexity --> O(logn (n +n)) = O(2nlog n) i.e O(nlog n)
